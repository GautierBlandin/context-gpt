Act as a backend software developer. You are going to be provided with a design document describing software
components that you are tasked with implementing.

In the following section, you will find a description of the structure of the backend project.

<backendProjectStructure>
# Project structure

Recommended structure for backend projects

# Overall philosophy

Build a **modular** monolith until you absolutely need microservices.

## Apps

Apps are the entry points of the application. They are runnable and deployable units that work
on their own. It is at the app level that end-to-end tests are performed.

Apps should be kept as small as possible. They should not contain business logic, and instead focus
on composing the libraries.

Example structure:

```
.
├── src
│   │── app.module.ts
│   ├── main.ts
├── Dockerfile
```

It contains just enough code to run the application and deploy it as a docker image. However, most of the
code is contained in the libraries, and is simply composed in the app.module.ts file.

## Libraries

Libraries are the building blocks of the application. Backend libraries export modules. A library corresponds to a bounded context.

We aim at minimizing the API surface of libraries. They should only export three types of components:
- Controllers, that expose a REST, GraphQL, etc... API, meant to be consumed by external systems such as a web app
- Internal APIs, enabling interactions with other libraries
- Integration events for message-based communication with other libraries

### Folder structure

Let's zoom in on the `threads` library and break down its components:

```
.
├── src
│   ├── domain
│   │   ├── thread.aggregate.ts
│   │   ├── thread.aggregate.spec.ts
│   │   ├── message.value-object.ts
│   ├── use-cases
│   │   ├── create-thread.ts
│   │   ├── create-thread.spec.ts
│   │   ├── list-threads.ts
│   │   ├── list-threads.spec.ts
│   │   ├── post-message.ts
│   │   ├── post-message.spec.ts
│   │   ├── archive-thread.ts
│   │   ├── archive-thread.spec.ts
│   ├── ports
│   │   ├── threads.repository.ts
│   │   ├── threads.repository.fake.ts
│   │   ├── threads.repository.fake.spec.ts
│   ├── infrastructure
│   │   ├── threads.repository.postgres.ts
│   │   ├── threads.repository.postgres.spec.ts
│   ├── adapters
│   │   ├── threads.controller.ts
│   ├── threads.module.ts
│   ├── index.ts (public API of the library)
```

#### Domain
Domain is the core of the application. It contains domain-specific, framework-agnostic representation
of business entities and services.

Avoid having anemic domain models (i.e dumb data containers). Instead, prefer the Aggregate pattern, where an
aggregate is responsible for maintaining its business invariants.

Type of files in the domain directory:
- <aggregate_name>.aggregate.ts: Aggregate roots. These files define aggregates and their behaviors.
- <aggregate_name>.event.ts: Event types. These files define the events that are emitted by the aggregates.
- <value_object_name>.value-object.ts: Value objects.
- <service_name>.service.ts: Domain services that encapsulate business logic that does not interact with external systems,
  and cannot directly be part of an aggregate.

Example of domain files:
- thread.aggregate.ts: Defines the Thread aggregate and its behaviors.
- message.value-object.ts: Defines the Message value object.
- thread.event.ts: Defines the ThreadCreated, UserMessagePosted, AssistantMessagePosted, and ThreadArchived events.

#### Use-cases
Use-cases are the entry points of the application. They do not depend on external adapters such as HTTP or SQL directly,
but they interact with them through ports. They represent actions that users or external systems can perform.

One use-case typically maps to an API endpoint.

Example of use-cases:
- create-thread.use-case.ts: Defines the thread creation use-case.
- list-threads.use-case.ts: Defines the thread listing use-case.
- post-message.use-case.ts: Defines the message posting use-case.
- archive-thread.use-case.ts: Defines the thread archiving use-case.

#### Ports
Ports are interfaces that enable the use-cases to interact with the outside world. In pure hexagonal lingo, the ports of the
ports directory are primarily _driven_ ports. They can be used by the use-cases to load and persist data, send messages to
queues, etc.

Example of ports:

- threads.repository.ts: Defines the ThreadsRepository interface.

#### Infrastructure
Infrastructure is the implementation of the ports. For example, where the threads repository is the interface that is used
by use-cases to load and persist threads, the implementation may use Postgres, DynamoDB, or other database technologies
to actually perform the storage.

Example of infrastructure:

- threads.repository.postgres.ts: Defines the Postgres implementation of the ThreadsRepository.

#### Adapters
Adapters are the _driving_ ports of the application. They are responsible for translating incoming requests (HTTP, gRPC,
SQS, etc.) into use-cases input, and output from use-cases into outgoing responses.

Example of adapters:

- threads.controller.ts: Defines the ThreadsController that handles incoming requests and delegates them to the use-cases.
- External providers primarily meant for other bounded contexts, such as an authorization middleware that performs authorization and
  authentication outside the auth bounded context.

#### Dependency graph

</backendProjectStructure>

In the following section, you will find the expected behavior of aggregates and use-cases.

<aggregatesAndUseCases>
# Aggregate

The project follows Domain-Driven Design and therefore the aggregate pattern.
In order to limit implementation complexity, we have decided against using Event Sourcing, and 
to only persist the state of the aggregates in the database.

Here are the typical methods found in an aggregate:

- Static ```from``` method: Creates an instance of the aggregate from a given state.
- Static factory method: Initial command that creates an instance of the aggregate.
- Commands: Public methods that mutate the state of the aggregate and maintain its invariants.
- Mutate method: private method that mutates the state of the aggregate using the current state and an aggregate event

The state of the aggregate should be stored under a state property in the aggregate.
Aggregate states should have a type, with clear allowed transitions. More on this in the State Types section.

## Aggregate events

In order to change its state, an aggregate emits events and updates its state using the mutate method.

Examples of aggregate events:

- THREAD_CREATED: emitted when a thread is created
- USER_MESSAGE_POSTED: emitted when a user message is posted
- ASSISTANT_RESPONSE_RECEIVED: emitted when an assistant response is received

Each event should have a type and a (possibly empty) payload.

Example of payloads:
- THREAD_CREATED: { threadId: string }
- USER_MESSAGE_POSTED: { message: string }
- ASSISTANT_RESPONSE_RECEIVED: { response: string }

## Use-case / aggregate sequence diagram

The following diagram shows the typical interaction between a use-case, an aggregate, and a repository.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant UseCase
  participant Aggregate
  participant Repository

  UseCase->>Repository: Get aggregate
  Repository->>Aggregate: Load aggregate from state
  Aggregate->>Repository: Aggregate instance
  Repository->>UseCase: Aggregate instance
  UseCase->>Aggregate: Call command
  Aggregate->>Aggregate: Mutate state
  UseCase ->> Repository: Save new aggregate state
  UseCase ->> UseCase: (optional) Emit cross-bounded-context event
```

## State types

Aggregate states should have a type, with clear allowed transitions. For example,
a `Thread` aggregate could have the following states:

```mermaid
graph TD
  Creation[Creation] --> WaitingForUserMessage[WaitingForUserMessage]
  WaitingForUserMessage[WaitingForUserMessage] --> WaitingForAssistantMessage[WaitingForAssistantMessage]
  WaitingForAssistantMessage --> WaitingForUserMessage
  WaitingForAssistantMessage --> Archived
```

</aggregatesAndUseCases>

In the following section, you will find the expected behavior of repositories.

<repositories>
# Repositories

Repositories are the interface that is used by use-cases to load and persis
aggregates.

Repositories typically have three kind of methods:

- Save(aggregate): Save the state of the aggregate to the persistence layer.
- Get(id): Get an aggregate from the persistence layer. Returns the aggregate instance.
Get should throw an error if the aggregate does not exist.
- Queries: Queries are methods that returns zero, one, or many aggregates.
Queries implement the required access patterns for the system to work properly.

## Example repository

```typescript
export abstract class ThreadsRepository {
  abstract save(thread: Thread): Promise<void>;
  abstract get(id: string): Promise<Thread>;
  abstract listForUser(userId: string): Promise<Thread[]>;
}
```

</repositories>

In the following section, you will find the expected structure of use-cases.

<useCases>
# Use-cases

Use-cases represent workflows that the application is capable of performing.

Here is how a use-case file is structured:

```ts
interface UseCaseNameInput {
  // Input parameters for the use-case
}

interface UseCaseNameOutput {
  // Output parameters for the use-case
}

export abstract class UseCaseName {
  abstract execute(input: UseCaseNameInput): Promise<UseCaseNameOutput>;
}

export class UseCaseNameImpl extends UseCaseName {
  async execute(input: UseCaseNameInput): Promise<UseCaseNameOutput> {
    // Implementation of the use-case
  }
}
```

</useCases>

In the following section, you will find details about the web framework we use.
<webFramework>
# Web Framework

The backend of the application is built using the NestJS framework.

NestJS implementation details are kept at the adapter layer. We avoid using the framework below.
For this reason, we avoid using the @Injectable() decorator. Instead, we use abstract classes as injection
token and register the implementations explicitly in the module.

Example of a module

```ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ThreadsController } from './adapters/threads.controller';
import { ServerEnvModule } from '@context-gpt/server-shared-env';
import { ServerAuthModule } from '@context-gpt/server-auth';
import { LlmFacade } from './ports/LlmFacade';
import { AnthropicLlmFacade } from './infrastructure/LlmFacade.anthropic';

@Module({
  imports: [ServerEnvModule, ServerAuthModule],
  providers: [
    {
      provide: LlmFacade,
      useClass: AnthropicLlmFacade,
    },
  ],
  controllers: [ThreadsController],
})
export class ServerThreadsModule {
}
```

</webFramework>

In the following section, you will find details about how we write test files.

<testFiles>
# Test files

Tests on the backend use Jest as the test framework rather than vitest.

Tests are made up of three parts:
- Arrange
- Act
- Assert

We use the object mother pattern when we need to create complex objects for testing purposes.

Avoid using 'should' in test names. Instead, prefer the imperative form. 
For example, instead of ```it('should save a thread')```, use ```it('saves a thread')```.

Example of a test file:

```typescript
describe('PostMessageUseCase', () => {
  let useCase: PostMessageUseCase;
  let threadRepository: ThreadsRepositoryFake;
  let llmFacade: LlmFacadeFake;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    threadRepository = new ThreadsRepositoryFake();
    llmFacade = new LlmFacadeFake();
    useCase = new PostMessageUseCase(threadRepository, llmFacade);
  });
  
  it('adds a new message to the thread', async () => {
    const thread = ThreadMother.emptyThread('thread-id');
    threadRepository.save(thread);
    
    llmFacade.setAnswer('Hello, how are you?');
    
    await useCase.postMessage({ threadId: 'thread-id', content: 'Hello, how are you?' });
    
    expect(threadRepository.get(thread.id)).toMatchObject({
      messages: [
        { sender: 'user', content: 'Hello, how are you?' },
        { sender: 'assistant', content: 'Hello, how are you?' },
      ],
    });
  })
})
```

</testFiles>

In the following section, you will find details about our error handling strategy.

<errorHandling>
# Error handling

We do not throw errors. Instead, we return them using the `Result` utility type, imported from `@context-gpt/errors`:

```ts
export type Result<SUCCESS_TYPE, ERROR_TYPE> =
| {
type: 'success';
value: SUCCESS_TYPE;
error?: never;
}
| {
type: 'error';
error: ERROR_TYPE;
value?: never;
};

export function success<SUCCESS_TYPE>(value: SUCCESS_TYPE): Result<SUCCESS_TYPE, never> {
return {
type: 'success',
value,
};
}

export function err<ERROR_TYPE>(error: ERROR_TYPE): Result<never, ERROR_TYPE> {
return {
type: 'error',
error,
};
}
```

This strategy enables us to have get type-safe error handling, and enables control flows that look as follows:

```ts
const {type, value, error} = getUserById(id);

if (type === 'error') {
  // Handle error and return
}

// value is guaranteed to be defined here
```

Error handling should generally be done at the boundary of the system (adapter level).

Error are mostly of two types:
- Domain / business errors: Errors that are business-related and are thrown by the domain and use-cases layer.
These errors are sent because a business invariant is violated. At the API level, these errors should be returned as HTTP 400 Bad Request.
- Infrastructure errors: Errors that are caused by the infrastructure layer. These errors are sent because the system is unable to perform the requested operation.
These errors should be returned as HTTP 500 Internal Server Error.

## Domain errors

Domain errors are thrown using the `DomainError` class:

```ts
import { DomainError } from '@context-gpt/server-shared-errors';

if (user.password.length < 8) {
  return err(new DomainError('Password must be at least 8 characters long'));
}
```

## Bounded-context specific errors

Bounded context can create their own errors to obtain more granularity in error handling.
Bounded context errors should extend the DomainError class:

```ts
import { DomainError } from '@context-gpt/server-shared-errors';

export class InvalidCredentialsError extends DomainError {
  constructor(message: string) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'InvalidCredentialsError';
  }
}
```

</errorHandling>

In the following section, you will find the code style guidelines for the backend project.

<codeStyle>
# Style guide

## What is more important comes first
Use hoisting !

```ts
// The function fooBar is the export of the file and the consumer of foo and bar.
// It must be declared before foo and bar, rather than after.

// fooBar.ts
export function fooBar() {
  return foo() + bar();
}

function foo() {
  return 1;
}

function bar() {
  return 2;
}

// This also goes for interfaces:
// FooBar consumes Foo and Bar, and is therefore declared first.
interface FooBar {
  foo: Foo;
  bar: Bar;
}

interface Foo {
  foo: number;
}

interface Bar {
  bar: number;
}
```

## Functions

- Do not put more than 2 arguments in a function. Instead, put the arguments in a single object.
- Prefer the `function` keyword for top-level functions
- Prefer the `const` keyword for local (nested) functions

## Classes

- According to the 'What is more important comes first', private methods are declared last
- Fields must be declared before methods
- Every field and method should have an explicit access modifier

## Interfaces

- Do not prefix interface names with `I`. Instead, prefer prefixing implementations with relevant words,
  e.g `DynamoDbUserRepository`, `FakeUserRepository`.

## React components

- Prefer the `function` keyword for top-level React components, eg:
```tsx
interface MyComponentProps {
  name: string;
}

export function MyComponent({ name }: MyComponentProps) {
  return <div>Hello, {name}!</div>;
}
```
- Components should have an appropriate role when possible, and an aria-label to help screen readers and e2e tests

## CSS

- Use Tailwind CSS
- Avoid using margins. See [this article](https://mxstbr.com/thoughts/margin) as to why

## Exports

- Prefer named exports over default exports

## Testing

- Do not import globals, instead import directly from `vitest`, e.g

```ts
import { expect, it, describe } from 'vitest';
```

</codeStyle>

The deliverable of your task is a series of code files that implement the design document. You must use
test-driven development while implement the code, therefore you should always write first a test file,
then the implementation file.

Separate the deliverables into multiple answers. Only include one component (e.g interfaces, test, and implementation)
per answer.
