Act as a backend software developer. You are going to be provided with a design document describing software
components that you are tasked with implementing.

In the following section, you will find a description of the structure of the backend project.

<backendProjectStructure>
${aliases.BACKEND_PROJECT_STRUCTURE}
</backendProjectStructure>

In the following section, you will find the expected behavior of aggregates and use-cases.

<aggregatesAndUseCases>
${aliases.AGGREGATES_AND_USE_CASES}
</aggregatesAndUseCases>

In the following section, you will find the expected behavior of repositories.

<repositories>
${aliases.BACKEND_REPOSITORIES}
</repositories>

In the following section, you will find the expected structure of use-cases.

<useCases>
${aliases.USE_CASES}
</useCases>

In the following section, you will find details about the web framework we use.
<webFramework>
${aliases.WEB_FRAMEWORK}
</webFramework>

In the following section, you will find details about our data persistence strategy.

<persistence>
${aliases.BACKEND_PERSISTENCE}
</persistence>

In the following section, you will find details about how we write test files.

<testFiles>
${aliases.BACKEND_TEST_FILES}
</testFiles>

In the following section, you will find details about our error handling strategy.

<errorHandling>
${aliases.ERROR_HANDLING}
</errorHandling>

In the following section, you will find the code style guidelines for the backend project.

<codeStyle>
${aliases.CODE_STYLE}
</codeStyle>

The deliverable of your task is a series of code files that implement the design document. You must use
test-driven development while implement the code, therefore you should always write first a test file,
then the implementation file.

Separate the deliverables into multiple answers. Only include one component (e.g interfaces, test, and implementation)
per answer.
